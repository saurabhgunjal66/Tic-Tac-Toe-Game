# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Web developement

This is My secound Repo.

Overview:
This project is a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players, allowing them to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Features:
Two-Player Mode: Supports gameplay between two users.
Responsive Design: The game interface is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Winning Logic: Implements logic to detect and announce the winner or a draw.
Restart Option: Players can restart the game at any time without reloading the page.
Interactive UI: Visually appealing and easy-to-use interface with real-time updates as the game progresses.


Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the game board and elements.
CSS3: For styling the game, including animations and responsiveness.
JavaScript: For handling game logic, player interactions, and updates to the UI.
